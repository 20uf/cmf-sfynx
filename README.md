CMF SFYNX Bundles
=====================


SFYNX is not just to simplify the developper's work, and to speed up the creation and maintenance of your PHP web 
applications. It also allows you to create your own CMS. It's a CMF easy to use, build your own template (layout), add your own custom block
 with your own logic, build all the widget you need.

## Structure of the framework

The framework works with Symfony 2.3 and has been split into 17 bundles :


``` bash

## Installation

### Step 0: Configuring Serveur

Before starting coding, make sure that your local system is properly
configured for Symfony.

Execute the `check.php` script from the command line:

``` bash

    php app/check.php

```

**Required** : 

- PHP with at least version 5.3.2 of PHP (php5.4.4 recommended)
- Sqlite3 must be enabled
- JSON must be enabled
- Ctype must be enabled
- PHP-XML module must be installed
- Installtion the gd library (for images)
- PHP.ini must have the extensions:

    * php-pear php5-dev php5-gd  php5-curl  php5-imap php5-mcrypt 
    * php5-geoip avec la database GeoLiteCountry/GeoIP.dat.gz (optional)
    * php-apc avec APC 3.0.17+ 
    * Intl (php5-intl) doit être installé avec ICU 4+
    * timezonedb pour le parametre date.timezone
    * JSON doit être activé
    * pdo, pdo_mysql 
    * php5-memcache / php5-memcached (optional)
    * activation d'envoi de mail
         - sous windows : 
              - SMTP = smtp-host-value
              - smtp_port = smtp-port-value
         - sous linux :
              - sendmail_path = "var-bin-sendmail"    
    
**Doctrine** : 

To use Doctrine, you will need to have installed PDO. And you must have installed the PDO driver for the database server you want to use.    

### Step 1: Configuring parameters  BDD and mailer

* Open the file app / config / parameters.ini
* Give the name "mydatabase" for example in the database and choose the type pdo_mysql to use a MySQL database.
* Give your user and password of your Gmail count.
* Change the secret code that will be used to protect your application from XSS attacks.

``` bash
parameters:
    database_driver:   pdo_mysql
    database_host:     127.0.0.1
    database_port:     ~
    database_name:     symfsfynx22
    database_user:     root
    database_password: ~

    test_database_driver:   pdo_mysql
    test_database_host:     127.0.0.1
    test_database_port:     null
    test_database_name:     symfsfynx23_test
    test_database_user:     root
    test_database_password: pacman 

    mailer_transport:  sendmail
    mailer_host:       127.0.0.1
    mailer_user:       ~
    mailer_password:   ~

    locale:            en_GB
    secret:            5b5a0ff57bd45284dafe7f104fc7d8e15
    
    # memcache params
    session_memcache_host: 127.0.0.1 # 127.0.0.1
    session_memcache_port: 11211 # 11211
    session_memcache_prefix: sess_memcache_
    session_memcache_expire: 864000
    session_memcache_locking: true      
    session_memcache_spin_lock_wait: 150000      

    #pi_app_admin 
    pi_cookie_lifetime: 604800
    pi_session_name: "PHPSESSID"
    
    #boot_strap_ws
    ws_key: 0A1TG4GO  
    
    #esi key
    esi_key: 9eu9ghv9
```

### Step 2: Setting up Permissions

* The directories below should be writable by both the web server and the user.
* On a UNIX system, if your web server is different from your user, you can run the following commands once in your project to ensure that the permissions are correctly installed. 
* We must change www-data on your web server.

Many systems allow you to use ACL chmod a +.
**For more information** : http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/installation.html

``` bash
mkdir web/uploads
mkdir web/uploads/media
mkdir web/yui

chmod –R 0777 app/cachesfynx
chmod –R 0777 app/cache
chmod –R 0777 app/log
chmod –R 0777 web/uploads
chmod –R 0777 web/yui
```

### Step 3: Installing the vendor

As Symfony uses [Composer][2] to manage its dependencies, the recommended way
to create a new project is to use it.

If you don't have Composer yet, download it following the instructions on
http://getcomposer.org/ or just run the following command:

``` bash

    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    
```    
    
**Setting vendor with composer.json**
``` bash

    php  composer.phar install

```

### Step 4: Create database, tables and fixtures with phing

**Execute initialize.xml configuration**
``` bash

    phing -f app/phing/initialize.xml rebuild

```

### Step 5: Create database, tables and fixtures without phing

**Type the following command to create the database**

``` bash

    php  app/console  doctrine:database:create

```

**Type the following command to create the tables**

``` bash

    php  app/console  doctrine:schema:create

```

**Type the following command to install fixtures of the tables**

``` bash

    php  app/console  doctrine:fixtures:load

```

**Type the following command to install assets of the bundles**

``` bash

    php app/console assets:install web

```

**For more information** : http://symfony.com/doc/current/bundles/DoctrineFixturesBundle/index.html

### Step 6: Connexion on /login

To connect as default super administrator:

``` bash

    Username: superadmin
    Password: superadmin

```

**The password must be changed at the first use.**

### Step 7: Run the tests

``` bash
    
    phpunit -c app/
    casperjs test app/Tests/casperjs/ --base-url=127.0.0.1:4042 --pre=app/Resources/casperjs/pre.js

```
